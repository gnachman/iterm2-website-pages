<pre id="changelist814535211252508711" style="display: none">Major New Features
------------------
- Deep tmux integration!
  Have you ever had an ssh session lost because you had to reboot, had a network
  failure, or the power went out? Are you tired of giving up a keystroke to tmux
  or screen? Suffer no longer! iTerm2 and tmux are now deeply integrated. By
  installing a special version of tmux, it gains the ability to speak directly to
  iTerm2. When you run tmux with -CC, iTerm2 will open real, native windows or
  tabs for each tmux window. The whole state of your tmux session is reflected in
  native iTerm2 windows. As you interact with a window, your typing is sent back
  to tmux. Any time you resize a window, add a split pane, close a split pane,
  close a window, or open a window (with Shell-&gt;tmux-&gt;new window), that
  action happens in tmux as well as in iTerm2.
  All the details are at https://code.google.com/p/iterm2/wiki/TmuxIntegration

- A "Toolbelt" has been added. It's a drawer that opens to the right of a
  window and shows running jobs, paste history, a field for taking notes, and
  lets you open new windows/tabs/splits. Look for the Toolbelt menu.

- Add "triggers." A trigger is an action that is performed when text matching
  some regular expression is received in a terminal session. More info here:
  http://www.iterm2.com/triggers.html

- Add "coprocesses." A coprocess is a process, such as a script, that receives
  input from a terminal and whose output is fed into the terminal session as
  though the user were typing it. You can use them to automate interaction with
  scripts, download files with ZModem, and more. More info here:
  http://iterm2.com/coprocesses.html

- You can now edit the smart selection regexes in
  Prefs&gt;Profiles&gt;Advanced. You can also assign actions that are added to
  the context menu when you right click on text that matches a smart selection
  rule.  More info here:
  http://www.iterm2.com/smartselection.html

- Support for OS 10.7 features including fullscreen, retina graphics, and
  window restoration.


New Preferences
---------------
- Add support for tiled background images (Foy Savas)
- Add a preference to toggle hiding of the menu bar in non-Lion fullscreen.
  Useful in Mavericks multi-monitor setups.
- Make tabview toggleable in fullscreen.
- Add option to dim background windows.

- Add preference to disable dimming animation.
- Add option to profiles to send text to shell at startup.
- Add option to disable session-initiated printing.
- Add support for loading prefs from a custom folder (e.g., Dropbox) or URL.
  This makes it easy to share a config between multiple machines or people.
- Add auto logging of sessions. When enabled (per-profile), all input received
  from the host in a session is saved to a file tagged with the window, tag,
  and pane number, plus the time and date of initiation.
- Add next/previous pane action.
- Change around prompt-to-quit options, adding "always/never/only if jobs
  besides ... are running" to profiles-sessions.
- Add option to copy trailing newlines when making a selection that includes a
  whole line at its end.
- Add preference to disable transparency when entering fullscreen mode.
- Improve "Terminal.app Compatibility" key preset to more accurately emulate
  Terminal.
- You can now configure what happens when you cmd-click on a filename in
  Prefs&gt;Profiles&gt;Advanced.
- Add key action to move tab left/right.
- Add "advanced" directory settings for separate tab, window, and pane settings.
- Add preference for setting locale vars.
- Add preference to disable saving lines to the scrollback buffer while in
  alternate screen mode.
- Add option to always copy preferences to prefs stored in a custom folder.
- Add a new panel to prefs to make mouse actions configurable.

  one row.
- Add hidden option AutocompleteMaxOptions to adjust number of autocomplete
  entries.
- Add hidden option PasteHistoryMaxOptions to adjust number of paste history
  entries.
- Add hidden variable URLCharacterSet that defines characters that are part of
  a URL.
- Disable title reporting unless hidden pref AllowInsecureTitleReporting is set
  to true.
- Add general preference "Adjust window for font size change". Turn it off so
  that the window size stays fixed as the font grows or shrinks (thanks,
  keeyipchan!).
- Add hidden preference PinchToChangeFontSizeDisabled to turn off pinch to
  change font size
- Ask for confirmation before deleting a profile.
- Add boolean hidden pref, OpenFileInNewWindows. When you open a file (e.g., a
  shell script) in finder with iTerm2, this controls whether it opens in a new
window or tab.
- Additional window styles: bottom and left of screen.

New Terminal Features
---------------------
- Add support for italics (Stefan Schüßler)
- Change RIS code to move the cursor to the origin (saitoha).
- Convert text to NFC form more aggressively, which should lead to latin
  characters with accents rendering more consistently with certain fonts like
  Inconsolata, which lacks some combining marks.
- Add ITERM_SESSION_ID environment variable that identifiers the window, tab,
  and pane number of each session.
- Add escape code "Esc c" to reset terminal.
- Add new escape code ESC ]6;1;bg;*;default^G to restore tab color to default.
- Add support for reporting focus lost/gained. esc[?1004h turns it on; then the
  terminal sends esc[I when focusing, esc[O when de-focusing. Send esc[?1004l
  to disable.
- Implemented bracketed paste mode (this is cool, see vim script here:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5585129
- Define VLNEXT and VDISCARD in the term by default.
- Add support for the "screen" terminal's way of setting the window title.
- Support SGR (1006) mouse reporting.
- Allow OSC 4 to set color of first 16 palette entries.
- Add support for OSC 52 (clipboard integration--thanks, saitoha!).
- Add support for DECSCUSR which lets the terminal change the cursor shape and
  blink.
- Add support for DECSTR (esc [!p)

Other Features
--------------
- Improve rendering on glyphs with multiple combining marks.
- When you cmd-click on a filename in a diff, remove the a/ or b/ prefix and
  replace with the real directory to open the file.
- Cmd-opt click on a URL to open it without bringing the browser to the front.
- Improve "send input to all sessions", adding new modes: 1) send to all panes
  in current tab, 2) to all sessions in current window, and 3) to an arbitrary
  collection of panes (toggled with context menu).
- You can toggle send input to all tabs/panes by re-pressing the keystroke that
  got you into that mode.
- Draw a dotted line around maximized sessions.
- Add support for multiple saved window arrangements.
- Add decimal <-> hex conversion to right-click context menu when a number is
  selected.
- Add new cmd-opt-shift-H and cmd-opt-shift-v interface for opening a split
  pane with a particular profile.
- Allow pinch gesture to change font size.
- Make cmd-[ and cmd-] work when a pane is maximized.
- Add "find cursor" feature (cmd-/) that highlights the cursor location. Useful
  when you have a huge terminal, this makes it easy to quickly find a lost
  cursor. If activated with the shortcut cmd-/, continuing to hold cmd will keep
  the highlighting active.
- Add ability to drag split panes around by pressing cmd-opt-shift and drgging.
- Add ability to split a pane by dragging a tab into a terminal session.
- Add "move session to split pane" option to context menu.

- By default, a three-finger click on a trackpad emulates the middle button
  (which by default performs Paste).
- Add ability to change profile from Edit Current Session.
- Change mouse cursor to indicate that mouse reporting is on.
- Add cmd-shift-opt-T to open a new tab using the current session's profile.
- Change default global key bindings to cmd-shift-arrows to move tab left/right.
- Add menu item to move tab left/right.
- Add title bars to split panes that show the title. You can drag panes by
  their titles, and there is a menu and a close button in it as well.
- If no window is open, you can now select multiple items in the profiles and
  window and choose split horizontally/vertically to open a new window with the
  split.
- Add tab colors to view menu and tab context menu (thanks, andreax79)
- Add 'move session to window' context menu item.
- When closing a session, free its scrollback buffer in a background thread to
  avoid hanging.
- Alt-click moves the cursor to the click position.
- Press cmd-9 to go to the last tab.
- Add menu item to toggle broadcasting input to the current pane (make
  pane-by-pane toggling available to focus-follows-mouse users who couldn't
  open a context menu in a deselected pane)
- "Find" continues to search as new text appears.

System Integration
------------------
- In Mavericks, when system prefs are set such that multiple screens share one
  space, we only hide the dock and menu when a fullscreen iTerm2 window is on
  the first screen.
- Handle inserting emoji text in mavericks with cmd-ctrl-space.
- Make dock and menu bar appear by moving mouse to top/bottom of screen in
  non-Lion fullscreen mode. Remove hold-cmd-for-tabs.

- Make find text typed in one tab appear in all tabs' find bars.
- App bundle is now signed.
- When a file or folder is dragged onto the dock icon, open it in a new tab
  (not a new window).
- Retina graphics

Proprietary Escape Codes
------------------------
- Add escape code <Esc>]50;SetMark^G to perform Edit > Set Mark command.
- Add escape code to steal focus: ESC ]50;StealFocus^G  (thanks, gordolio).
- Add proprietary escape code esc]50;ClearScrollback^G to erase screen and
  scrollback buffer.
- Add proprietary escape code esc]50;CurrentDir=/Path/To/Directory^G to notify
  iTerm2 of the current directory (so you can cmd-click on relative filenames
  and we'll know where they are).
- Add proprietary escape code <esc>]50;SetProfile=X^G to set the current
  session's profile to the one named X.- Add proprietary escape code to send
  text to clipboard. To use, send esc]50;CopyToClipboard=X^G followed by text
  followed by esc]50;EndCopy^G, where X is a clipboard name from the set: ruler,
  find, font, or general. If not specified, general is used.
- Add esc]50;RequestAttention=x^G, where if x=1 the dock icon bounces and if
  x=0 it stops.

- The setting "Open tmux windows as tabs in existing

  windows you create after attaching. The old behavior
  prevented you from creating unattached windows in tmux
  integration mode.

Bug Fixes:
- Fix a bug that caused iTerm2 to hang when using the
  Metal renderer
- Fix a few crashes
- Temporarily disable the Metal renderer while a view is
  being resized to avoid seeing it stretched.
- Fix support for double-struck bold text in the Metal
  renderer.
- Fix a bug where new windows would draw incorrectly
  sometimes when using the Metal renderer.
- Turn off Metal renderer when Find or Paste views are
  open because they don't always composite correctly.

New Features:
- Add an advanced setting to disable wraparound in
  directional split pane navigation.
- Add an advanced setting that allows TAB codes to wrap
  around to the next line. This is useful to preserve
  tabs for text you plan to paste but could break
  backward compatibility.
- Add an advanced pref to disable middle click closes
  tab.

  cursor.
- Adds a cancel button to "what kind of tab/window do you want?"
  when in tmux integration.
- Select and right click on dates like "Tue, 16 May 2017 06:32:33
  UTC" to show them in local time.

  will appear on back-to-front order.
- Fixes a memory leak in the password manager window.
- Fixes bugs in search where find next/previous would not always work.
- Restores the progress bar in the find window.
- Fixes text drawing problems in high sierra.
- Fixes a bug where undo close session could cause a critical error or
  tab without a session.
- Fixes a bug where the retina-only setting for thin strokes was not
  respected.
- Fixes a bug where the app would hang when a networked file system
  was in use.
- Fixes a bug where tabs dragged out of the tab bar into a new
  window caused the new window to appear in the wrong place.
- Fixes a bug where windows would disappear when switching displays.

Enhancements:
- Changes the shortcut for bury session to cmd-opt-shift-B so it's
  harder to do by accident.
- Improves the appearance of the tab activity indicator.
- Renames Don't Open Any Windows to Only Restore Hotkey Window to
  clarify its purpose.
- Updates the manpage touch bar button less frequently to reduce

<pre id="changelist4103040315579306580" style="display: none">New features:
- Add copy mode, like tmux's.
  https://iterm2.com/documentation-copymode.html
- Add an advanced preference to make auto logs filenames' formattable.
- Use secure copy to download files selected with cmd-click on a
  filename on a remote host and OSC 8 URLs with a file: scheme and a
  host part.
- You can now enable ligatures on any font, not only those in a
  whitelist. Your font may not have ligatures, in which case this will
  just hurt performance with no benefit.
- New APIs for the still-experimental websocket server. Docs are in the
  proto file.
- Add an advanced preference to allow different tmux sessions to have
  different profiles and to base the profile of the tmux sessions on the
  session that attached to tmux.
- Add a new touch bar button that reports status. Use it2setkeylabel set
  status "message". You could use it to show the current git branch in
  the touch bar. Pressing the button takes you to where the status was
  set.

Bug fixes:
- Fix a bug where the screen jumped around when scrolling by dragging
  the scroller.
- Improve how network automounts are detected. This helps us avoid
  stat()ing files on the network, which can cause hangs when semantic
  history tries to discover if a file exsts.
- Improve performance for moving line-by-line through a file by caching
  CTLineRef's.
- Keep process monitoring from eating too much CPU.
- Validate secure copy hostname and user name to ensure legal characters
  only are present.
- Fix a crash when the font is broken and reports a 0 size.

  allow them to be navigated to with find next/previous.
- Fix a bug where non-shell integration users could not reuse the
  current directory.
- Force everyone to upgrade to new shell integration version because of
  a security issue.
- Allow the password manager to open even if another sheet is already
  open.
- Draw the default background color behind inline images.
- Fix a bug where the "Edit password" button in the password manager
  would change your password into dots.
- Fix ligatures in Iosevka.
- Fix a bug where the wrong job name would be shown in the titlebar when
  there were two jobs that considered themselves foreground jobs.
- Fix a bug where the order of windows in applescript was random, not
  back to front.

<pre id="changelist6779093216081106567" style="display: none">New features:
- Add support for OSC 8 to do hypertext links. The syntax is:
  OSC 8 ; params ; url ST
    params is zero or more colon-delimited key=value strings. The only
  defined key is "id". Two adjacent hyperlinks with the same URL but
  different "id"s will not highlight together on hover. id is
  optional.
    As usual, OSC is 'esc ]' and st is 'esc \'.
- Trigger highlighting colors in a dynamic profile may use #rrggbb
  notation.
- Semantic history can now open file:line:column in VSCode.
- Change "Open in current space" for hotkey windows to move the hotkey
  window to the current space if it's already open on another space
  when the hotkey is pressed.
- Add an advanced pref to tweak the height of the underline cursor.
- Add an experimental feature to draw an outline around underline and
  vertical bar cursors to improve distinction from text.

Bug fixes:
- Add a send text request to the experimental API server
- Add an advanced pref to use full-height cursor (including vertical
  padding area)
- Draw underline and vertical line cursor behind text to
  improve readability.
- Update to Sparkle 1.17 (with iTerm2-specific patches)
- The first time the tmux gateway is auto-buried, open the
  sessions menu and point out how to restore it with a popover hanging
  off an invisible high-level window.
- Prevent marks from getting absurdly wide when margins are
  increased well beyond their defaults.
- Add a clear button to captured output tool.
- Fix a truly terrible memory leak.
- Fix a bug where double-tap of a modifier didn't work to open a
  hotkey window if it didn't also have a regular shortcut.
- Fix a leak of inline images.
- Fix a bug where sessions aren't restored correctly if the number of
  scrollback lines is small.
- Fix a bug where the find cursor UI would not be removed if you
  switched sessions while it was open.
- Improve performance in neovim by ensuring the display updates more
  regularly.
- Give scrollers a light appearance when the window has a dark
  appearance so they'll be visible.
- There's a hack to make the app active when the space changes
  to a lion fullscreen window and the app isn't active. This is needed
  only for LSUIElement apps, where the OS gets confused. Limit the
  hack to LSUIElement mode since you could use spaces and have two
  monitors.
- Use SRGB for OSC 6 ; 1 ; bg ; red ; brightness ; Pc ST. It
  was unstable before because I'd set the value in calibrated and then
  convert it to SRGB when modifying a different component.
- 6f9ab24 Don't crash on OSC 7 with bad URL.
- Fix a bug where we incorrectly removed the tab color from
  non-tmux sessions. It should have removed the tab color from tmux
  sessions that have one in the tmux profile but not in the saved
  session state.
- Handle ligatures in Firacode better if had previously turned off
  ligatures in a different ligature font.

  characters.
- Fix main thread deadlock when getting a process list is slow.

  of crashing.
- Ignore non-latin1 input to ReportVariable instead of throwing an
  exception.
- Don't crash when we're sent an inline file with no or invalid data.
