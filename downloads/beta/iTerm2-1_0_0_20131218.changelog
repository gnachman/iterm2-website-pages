iTerm2 1.0.0.20131218
Bug fixes.

- Fix a rare crashing bug.
- Fix a bug where non-ascii characters would sometimes draw incorrectly.
- Fix a bug where changing prefs/closing the prefs window would reset the 256-color color table.
- In Mavericks, when system prefs are set such that multiple screens share one space, we only hide the dock and menu when a fullscreen iTerm2 window is on the first screen.
- Revert to older method of drawing non-ascii characters except when combining marks are present, for performance.
- Be more permissive about parsing colors in prefs file to resolve an incompatibility with prefs files touched by the nightly build, which adds a colorspace element.
