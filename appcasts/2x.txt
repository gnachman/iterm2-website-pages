Important Features
------------------
- Deep tmux integration!
  Have you ever had an ssh session lost because you had to reboot, had a network
  failure, or the power went out? Are you tired of giving up a keystroke to tmux
  or screen? Suffer no longer! iTerm2 and tmux are now deeply integrated. By
  installing a special version of tmux, it gains the ability to speak directly to
  iTerm2. When you run tmux with -CC, iTerm2 will open real, native windows or
  tabs for each tmux window. The whole state of your tmux session is reflected in
  native iTerm2 windows. As you interact with a window, your typing is sent back
  to tmux. Any time you resize a window, add a split pane, close a split pane,
  close a window, or open a window (with Shell-&gt;tmux-&gt;new window), that
  action happens in tmux as well as in iTerm2.
  All the details are at https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/wikis/TmuxIntegration

- A "Toolbelt" has been added. It's a drawer that opens to the right of a
  window and shows running jobs, paste history, a field for taking notes, and
  lets you open new windows/tabs/splits. Look for the Toolbelt menu.

- Add "triggers." A trigger is an action that is performed when text matching
  some regular expression is received in a terminal session. More info here:
  http://www.iterm2.com/triggers.html

- Add "coprocesses." A coprocess is a process, such as a script, that receives
  input from a terminal and whose output is fed into the terminal session as
  though the user were typing it. You can use them to automate interaction with
  scripts, download files with ZModem, and more. More info here:
  http://iterm2.com/coprocesses.html

- You can now edit the smart selection regexes in
  Prefs&gt;Profiles&gt;Advanced. You can also assign actions that are added to
  the context menu when you right click on text that matches a smart selection
  rule.  More info here:
  http://www.iterm2.com/smartselection.html

- Support for OS 10.7 features including fullscreen, retina graphics, and
  window restoration.

New Terminal Features
---------------------
- Add support for italics (Stefan Schüßler)

  and pane number of each session.

  to disable.

  in current tab, 2) to all sessions in current window, and 3) to an arbitrary

  and we'll know where they are).

  session's profile to the one named X.- Add proprietary escape code to send
  text to clipboard. To use, send esc]50;CopyToClipboard=X^G followed by text
