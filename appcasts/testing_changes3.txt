3.1.6beta5
Changes vs 3.1.6beta4:

- Fix some bugs with selecting the wrong window in focus follow mouse.
- When you duplicate a profile with a hotkey window, make the
  duplicate profile not have a hotkey.
- Reject more false 3-finger taps.
- Respect 'open tmux windows as tabs in existing window' for windows
  created at the command line with 'tmux new-window'.
- Fix a bug where unburying a session could cause it to come back with
  the wrong window type. Fixes a similar bug with undo-close.

3.1.6beta4
Changes vs 3.1.6beta3:

Bug Fixes:
- Fix regex search that matches empty lines
- Fix bug where inline images didn't alway show properly in non-Metal
  renderer
- Fix a bug where timestamps would get stuck on.
- Fix a bug where having lots of empty lines could make state
  saving very slow.
- Warn when minimum contrast is very high since that causes text to be
  always black or white.
- Improve scrolling redraw frame rate with Metal renderer.
- Fixes a memory leak.
- Get inline images working with the Metal renderer.
- Disable Metal renderer when not connected to power. Controlled by a
  new advanced pref.

Other Changes:
- Add F21-F24 to Touch Bar


Changes vs 3.1.6beta2:
Other Changes:

- The setting "Open tmux windows as tabs in existing
  window" no longer applies to new tmux integration
  windows you create after attaching. The old behavior
  prevented you from creating unattached windows in tmux
  integration mode.

Bug Fixes:
- Fix a bug that caused iTerm2 to hang when using the
  Metal renderer
- Fix a few crashes
- Temporarily disable the Metal renderer while a view is
  being resized to avoid seeing it stretched.
- Fix support for double-struck bold text in the Metal
  renderer.
- Fix a bug where new windows would draw incorrectly
  sometimes when using the Metal renderer.
- Turn off Metal renderer when Find or Paste views are
  open because they don't always composite correctly.

New Features:
- Add an advanced setting to disable wraparound in
  directional split pane navigation.
- Add an advanced setting that allows TAB codes to wrap
  around to the next line. This is useful to preserve
  tabs for text you plan to paste but could break
  backward compatibility.
- Add an advanced pref to disable middle click closes
  tab.


3.1.6beta2
Changes vs 3.1.6beta1:

- Some bad memory leaks were fixed
- Improved emoji support in Metal renderer
- Fix a bug where the Metal renderer's availability wasn't tied to
  ligatures being disabled in all cases
- Fix support for moving sessions between retina/non-retina displays
  when using Metal renderer.

3.1.6beta1

This release features support for a new GPU-based renderer.

  a left-side tab bar that's limited by the 1/3 * content
  size bound will have fewer columns than it should.
